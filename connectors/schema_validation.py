"""
Youâ€™re fetching data from an API and expect each record to have these fields:

EXPECTED_FIELDS = ["id", "title", "body", "userId"]

Write a Python function that:

1. Takes a list of JSON objects (list[dict])
2. Validates each row has all expected fields
3. If a row is valid, keep it
4. If a row is invalid (missing any field), log it and skip it
